# CarSmash
CarSmash mulitplayer browser game still under development due to box2D js port memory leak. Game website carsmash.io (currently not working). Server side is made with node.js and I am planing to switch to java because of better memory management, and i think beter box2d implementation. See screenshot if You want to know how the game looks like.
